# Land portal integration

## Overview

The [Land portal](https://land.copernicus.eu/), released in September 2023, integrates the HR-VPP datasets by using a combination of
* the SDI integration, for the [_Dataset catalogue_](https://land.copernicus.eu/en/dataset-catalog) functionality
* the WEkEO broker integration and its Harmonized Data Access (HDA) API for making the datasets accessible via the [_Download by area_](https://land.copernicus.eu/en/products/vegetation/high-resolution-plant-phenology-index/download-by-area) and the [_Map or Data viewer_](https://land.copernicus.eu/en/map-viewer?dataset=a3a20c47159e47fdba4c488376624453)
* the WMTS/WMS service for the online map viewing

The Land portal furthermore includes:
* links to the technical documentation, tutorials, use cases and metadata records
* links to the WEkEO portal and API as alternative ways of accessing the HR-VPP datasets
* summary characteristics of all Land service products, including HR-VPP's, in the [_CLMS portfolio_](https://land.copernicus.eu/en/products)

## Updating the web content on the Land portal
To update the Land portal content related to HR-VPP's datasets, first check if the content is replicated from the SDI record.

If this is the case, then contact EEA's SDI team to update the (already published) SDI metadata records.
Otherwise, contact EEA and their portal contractor (currently a consortium led by Bilbomatica).

For user communications, such as news announcements, it is required to loop in the EEA communications team.
